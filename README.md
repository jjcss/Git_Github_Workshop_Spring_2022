## Git/Github Workshop

Thank you all for joining us for our **Git/Github Workshop on March, 15th, 2022**. For anyone who missed the meeting, we had two demos. In the first demo, the club went over how to connect your IDE (code-editor) to Github using Git, followed by committing and uploading your code to Github. In the second demo, we went over how you can use Git and Github for project collaboration amongst multiple people. 

We hope that you all learned a few valuable skills and we can't stress enough just how valuable learning and mastering how to use Git/Github will be once you get into the tech field. Below you will find the presentation slides, Zoom recording, some additional resources on common **Git** commands, and information on our next workshop. Have a good rest of your week and see you at our next workshop!
